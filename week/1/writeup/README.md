When it comes to morality and cyber-security issues in our society, you cannot simply state that this is right, and this is wrong. There are a lot of factors to consider before making a decision like this. The simple fact is, you know something that can affect the lives of many people. It is more of a burden than a privilege. The simplest action you can take is to take all of your findings to your boss. This is good because, the company can try and patch the exploit before public release. Your relationship with the company will remain on good terms and the issue will be resolved in house. If they are still unwilling to accept that the issue exists or want to remain oblivious to the fact that the exploit can become very dangerous if not taken care of before release, i will go up to the highest chain of command that i can reach and is willing to listen. if all else fails though, i will not release my findings to the public. In this modern age where social media hold high value, I might get a few likes and shares here and there, the issue will be known and might be trending for a couple of days, even weeks. Eventually though, people will still forget about it and move on to the next big thing. I might face legal and societal ramifications for my actions. sure, there might be a chance that the company doesn't go through with this following the outburst or aftermath or they go through with it and still make money. I will still be in deep water either way. The difference is how my how clear my conscious will be, and having a clear conscience is better than being guilty if anything were to happen. so, i would get legal counsel on how to proceed with presenting my findings in a way that will make sure the issue gets fixed before They can release it. That is the order in which i will proceed. If my council advises me to do nothing because of legal quandaries, and I end up taking his advice, i feel as though i will be partly responsible for any harmful outcomes. I did everything possible. Almost. That what if will probably affect me for the rest of my life. So, like I said, answering this kind of question is very difficult. I say one thing now, but i can never know what I will do if I was actually in that situation. That is what i meant by my first sentence.
