## Assignment 3 Writeup

### Part 1 (100 pts)

I have three suggestions for Mr. Krueger. Separate his work life from his personal life. Social media presence is well and good but without content control, it can leave you vulnerable to many attacks. His instagram account and twitter account had a lot of information about him and his work. I specifically cracked his password by brute forcing it but it didn’t take me a long time because I used a Pokémon character name list and I was able to crack his password in a matter of minutes. I was able to identify his system through minimal osint. His website had ports that were not secured. That coupled with his weak username and password, will expose him to many exploits. I would suggest implementing a firewall to help thwart threats. He should also analyze all the vulneribitlies in his system. That way he can take the appropriate counter measures. His admin server as running on a different Ip but it was still visible and accessible to public domain. This is not security wise as I was able to perform different scans on it to find a way in.
